# Upwork Proposal Guide (Client-Facing Copy)

## 60-second pitch

I build lightweight, custom CRM interfaces for teams that need a cleaner client workflow without the overhead of complex enterprise platforms. This sample project demonstrates client registration, searchable records, interaction tracking, and responsive UX designed for real operational use.

## Service positioning

This project supports proposals for:

- custom CRM front-end delivery;
- workflow digitization for client onboarding and follow-up;
- fast MVP implementation for sales and operations teams.

## Suggested project scope (proposal-ready)

1. Discovery call to map the client lifecycle and core fields.
2. UX structure for registration, search, and record visibility.
3. Front-end implementation with clean component organization.
4. Data persistence strategy (`localStorage` or API integration).
5. Documentation and handoff with next-step roadmap.

## Delivery differentiators

- business-first implementation decisions;
- clear communication and milestone accountability;
- codebase prepared for backend and database evolution.

## Reusable proposal template

Hello [Client Name],  
I can deliver a custom CRM workflow tailored to your operation, with a strong focus on usability, speed, and maintainability.  

Based on your goals, I propose building a clean interface for:

- client registration and data quality;
- searchable records and quick retrieval;
- interaction tracking for better relationship visibility.

The delivery can start as a fast MVP and be extended into a full product with API integration, role permissions, and reporting dashboards.

If helpful, I can also share a milestone breakdown and timeline after a brief discovery call.
